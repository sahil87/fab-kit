## Behavior

### Step 0a: Start Ship Stage

If an active change resolves (`fab change resolve 2>/dev/null`) and `progress.ship` is not `done`, attempt to start the `ship` stage:

```bash
fab status start <change> ship git-pr 2>/dev/null || true
```

This is best-effort — failures are silently ignored. If the stage is already `active`, the call is a no-op. If no active change, skip entirely.

### Step 0b: Resolve PR Type

Determine the PR type before gathering state. The type controls the PR title prefix and body template.

**Valid types**: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`

**Resolution chain** (evaluated in order, first match wins):

1. **Explicit argument**: If the user invoked `/git-pr {type}` where `{type}` is one of the 7 valid types (case-insensitive), normalize to lowercase and use it. If the argument is not a valid type, ignore it and fall through to step 2.

2. **Read from `.status.yaml`**: Run `fab change resolve 2>/dev/null`. If resolution succeeds, read `change_type` from `fab/changes/{name}/.status.yaml`. If non-null and one of the 7 valid types (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`), use it. Fall through if resolution fails, `change_type` is null, or `change_type` is not a valid type.

3. **Infer from fab change intake**: If `fab change resolve` succeeded (from step 2) and `fab/changes/{name}/intake.md` exists, read the intake content and pattern-match (case-insensitive). Keyword lists are evaluated in order — first match wins:
   - Contains any of: "fix", "bug", "broken", "regression" → type = `fix`
   - Contains any of: "refactor", "restructure", "consolidate", "split", "rename" → type = `refactor`
   - Otherwise → type = `feat`

4. **Infer from diff**: Collect changed file paths by running each command and taking the first non-empty result: (a) `git diff --name-only HEAD`, (b) `git diff --name-only --cached`, (c) `git diff --name-only @{u}..HEAD` (only if upstream exists). This covers uncommitted, staged, and committed-but-unpushed changes.

   If **no files** are returned (empty diff — clean working tree and no unpushed commits), default to `chore`.

   Otherwise, analyze the changed file paths:
   - All files in `.github/` or CI config files → type = `ci`
   - All files in `docs/` or non-code `.md` files → type = `docs`
   - All files in test directories or test files → type = `test`
   - Otherwise → type = `chore`

Store the resolved `type` (always lowercase) and the resolution source (`explicit`, `status`, `intake`, `diff`) for use in Step 3c.

This step MUST NOT ask questions or present options. If resolution is ambiguous, default to `chore`.

### Step 1: Gather State

Run these commands to understand the current situation:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --porcelain
git log --oneline -5
git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_UPSTREAM"
gh pr view --json number,state,url 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PR"
```

If an active change is resolved (via `fab change resolve`), read issues via `fab status get-issues <change>` and capture the output (one ID per line, may be empty).

Determine:
- **branch** — current branch name
- **has_uncommitted** — whether `git status --porcelain` has output
- **has_unpushed** — whether there are commits ahead of upstream (or no upstream at all)
- **has_pr** — whether a PR already exists
- **issues** — the issue IDs from `fab status get-issues` (space-joined), or empty if none

### Step 1b: Branch Mismatch Nudge

If there is an active change (resolve via `fab change resolve 2>/dev/null`), compare the current branch against the change name.

A match is: (1) exact string equality between current branch and change name, or (2) the change name appears as a substring of the current branch.

If there is **no match** and the current branch is **not** `main`/`master`, show a non-blocking nudge before proceeding:

```
Note: branch '{current_branch}' doesn't match active change '{change_name}'.
Run /git-branch to switch, or continue if this is intentional.
```

Then proceed to Step 2 normally. If resolution fails or there is no active change, skip this step silently.

### Step 2: Branch Guard

If the current branch is `main` or `master`, STOP immediately.

If there is an active change (from Step 1b), enhance the message:

```
Cannot create PR from main/master branch.
Tip: run /git-branch to switch to the change's branch first.
```

If there is no active change:

```
Cannot create PR from main/master branch.
```

Do NOT run any git operations.

### Step 3: Execute Pipeline

Run each step in order, skipping steps that aren't needed.

**If nothing to do** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits, PR exists):
```
/git-pr — already shipped

  ✓ pr — {existing PR URL}

Nothing to do.
```
Before stopping, attempt to record the existing PR URL per Steps 4a–4c (silently, no errors). Then STOP.

**Otherwise**, print the header and execute:

```
/git-pr — shipping to PR
```

#### 3a. Commit (if has_uncommitted)

1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Read `git log --oneline -5` for commit message style
3. Read `git diff --stat HEAD` for change scope
4. Generate a concise commit message matching the repo's existing style
   - Subject line only (unless changes warrant a body)
   - Do NOT include "Co-Authored-By" lines
5. Commit: `git commit -m "<message>"`
6. If commit fails → report error and STOP

Print: `  ✓ commit — "<commit subject>"`

#### 3b. Push (if has_unpushed or just committed)

1. Check if upstream exists: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u} 2>/dev/null`
2. If no upstream: `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`
3. If upstream exists: `git push`
4. If push fails → report the git error output and STOP

Print: `  ✓ push   — origin/<branch>`

#### 3c. Create PR (if no PR exists)

1. Verify `gh` is available: `command -v gh`
   - If missing → print `gh CLI not found — cannot create PR` and STOP

2. **Derive PR title**: Compute `{pr_title}` where:
   - If `fab change resolve 2>/dev/null` succeeds AND `fab/changes/{name}/intake.md` exists: `{title}` = first `# ` heading from `fab/changes/{name}/intake.md`, stripping `Intake: ` prefix if present
   - Otherwise: `{title}` = commit message subject line from `git log -1 --format=%s`

   If `issues` (from Step 1) is non-empty: `{pr_title}` = `{type}: {issues} {title}` (e.g., `feat: DEV-123 DEV-456 Add OAuth support`), where `{issues}` is space-joined.
   If `issues` is empty: `{pr_title}` = `{type}: {title}`.

   The `{pr_title}` variable (already prefixed) is used as-is in step 4's `gh pr create --title`.

3. **Generate PR body** using a single unified template with conditional field population based on artifact availability.

   **Resolve fab context** (attempt once, used for all conditional fields):
   - Run `fab change resolve 2>/dev/null`. If it succeeds, set `{has_fab} = true` and `{name}` = resolved change name
   - Check if `fab/changes/{name}/intake.md` exists → `{has_intake}`
   - Check if `fab/changes/{name}/plan.md` exists → `{has_plan}`
   - Check if `fab/changes/{name}/tasks.md` exists → `{has_tasks}` (legacy, pre-1.9.0)
   - Read `fab/changes/{name}/.status.yaml` for `id`, `name`, `confidence`, `plan`, `progress`, and `stage_metrics` fields
   - Read `fab/project/config.yaml` for the optional `linear_workspace` field under `project:` and the optional top-level `true_impact_exclude` list

   **Construct blob URLs** (only when `{has_fab}`):
   - `{owner_repo}` = `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner'`
   - `{branch}` = `git branch --show-current`
   - If `{has_intake}`: Intake URL = `https://github.com/{owner_repo}/blob/{branch}/fab/changes/{name}/intake.md`
   - If `{has_plan}`: Apply URL = `https://github.com/{owner_repo}/blob/{branch}/fab/changes/{name}/plan.md`
   - Else if `{has_tasks}`: Apply URL = `https://github.com/{owner_repo}/blob/{branch}/fab/changes/{name}/tasks.md` (legacy fallback for changes that predate the 1.8.0→1.9.0 migration)

   **Compute true-impact line counts** (only when `{has_fab}`): used to render the `**Impact**` line(s) in the Meta block below. The caller does not pre-check `true_impact_exclude` — it always invokes `fab impact`, which emits the `excluding` sub-block only when `true_impact_exclude` is non-empty and the `tests` sub-block only when `test_paths` is non-empty. The `**Impact**` line is omitted downstream when the total pass is absent (step 3) or yields `+0/−0` (step 4).

   1. Compute the merge-base against the default branch:
      ```bash
      BASE=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD 2>/dev/null) \
        || BASE=$(git merge-base origin/master HEAD 2>/dev/null)
      ```
      If neither resolves, omit the `**Impact**` line silently.

   2. Invoke `fab impact` to compute all passes in one call (the subcommand reads `true_impact_exclude` and `test_paths` from `fab/project/config.yaml` and emits a YAML doc with `added`/`deleted`/`net`, an optional `excluding` sub-block, and an optional `tests` sub-block):
      ```bash
      IMPACT_YAML=$(fab impact "$BASE" HEAD 2>/dev/null) || IMPACT_YAML=""
      ```
      If `fab impact` fails (non-zero exit) or `IMPACT_YAML` is empty → omit the `**Impact**` line entirely.

   3. Parse the YAML (e.g., via `yq`) for the **raw** pair, the **total** pair, and the optional **tests** pair:
      - **raw** = the top-level `{added,deleted,net}` (the full count, fab/ + docs/ included — the base measurement). Used only by the single-line form's trailing `total` pair (step 4 / Impact line population); the raw number is NOT shown in the three-row form.
      - **total** = `excluding.{added,deleted,net}` when the `excluding` sub-block is present, else the top-level (raw) `{added,deleted,net}`. The total is ALWAYS the scaffolding-excluded number when excludes are configured; the raw-with-fab/docs number is NOT shown in the PR body. (Unlike the legacy behavior, the `**Impact**` line is NOT omitted merely because `excluding` is absent — when `true_impact_exclude` is empty the total degenerates to the raw pair, which is still rendered.)
      - **tests** = `tests.{added,deleted,net}` when the `tests` sub-block is present; otherwise there is no tests pair (single-line rendering — see step 4).

   4. If the **total** pass yields `+0 / −0` (no net change in the measured universe) → omit the `**Impact**` line entirely. Do not render `+0/−0`.

   **Generate body sections** in this exact order:

   ```
   ## Meta

   | ID | Type | Confidence | Plan | Review |
   |----|------|-----------|------|--------|
   | {id} | {type} | {confidence} | {plan_cell} | {review_cell} |

   **Pipeline**: {pipeline_line}

   **Impact**: {impact_line}

   ## Summary

   {summary_text}

   ## Changes

   {changes_bullets}
   ```

   When `{has_fab}` is false, the entire `## Meta` block (table + Pipeline + Impact) is omitted; the body becomes just `## Summary` + `## Changes` (or just `## Summary` if no intake exists).

   **Meta table cell population** (only when `{has_fab}`):
   - **ID**: From `.status.yaml` `id` field (4-char change ID). Show `—` if unavailable.
   - **Type**: The resolved PR type (always present).
   - **Confidence**: `{confidence.score}/5.0` from `.status.yaml`. Show `—` if confidence data absent.
   - **Plan**:
     - If `{has_plan}` (1.9.0+): parse `plan.md` `## Tasks` for checkbox counts (`- [x]` vs `- [ ]`) → `{done}/{total} tasks`. Append `, {plan.acceptance_completed}/{plan.acceptance_count} acceptance` from `.status.yaml`. Append ` ✓` when both pairs are complete (`done == total > 0` AND `acceptance_completed == acceptance_count > 0`).
     - Else if `{has_tasks}` (legacy): parse `tasks.md` for `- [x]` vs `- [ ]` → `{done}/{total} tasks`. Append `, {checklist.completed}/{checklist.total} acceptance` from `.status.yaml`. Append ` ✓` when complete.
     - Else: `—`.
   - **Review**: Derive from `.status.yaml` `progress.review` state and `stage_metrics.review.iterations`:
     - `done` → `✓ {N} cycle{s}` (use `cycle` for 1, `cycles` otherwise)
     - `failed` → `✗ {N} cycle{s}`
     - any other state (pending, active) → `—`
     - If `iterations` is not populated, drop the count: `✓` / `✗` alone.

   **Issue rendering**: Issues are NOT shown in the Meta table (the table is fixed at 5 columns). When `issues` (from Step 1) is non-empty, append a `**Issues**: ...` line BELOW the `**Pipeline**:` line and ABOVE `**Impact**:`. If `linear_workspace` is configured in `fab/project/config.yaml`, render each issue as `[{ID}](https://linear.app/{linear_workspace}/issue/{ID})` joined with `, `; otherwise render bare IDs comma-joined. Omit the line when `issues` is empty.

   **Pipeline line population** (only when `{has_fab}`):

   List the six pipeline stages in fixed order — `intake → apply → review → hydrate → ship → review-pr` — separated by ` → `. For each stage:
   - If `.status.yaml` `progress.{stage}` is `done`, append ` ✓` after the stage label.
   - Stage labels are hyperlinks when an artifact exists:
     - `intake` → Intake URL (when `{has_intake}`)
     - `apply` → Apply URL (when `{has_plan}` or `{has_tasks}` — see Apply URL resolution above)
     - `review`, `hydrate`, `ship`, `review-pr` → always plain text (no per-change artifact)
   - Stages without an artifact and without `done` status render as plain text with no marker.

   **Impact line population** (only when `{has_fab}`):

   The Impact rendering has two forms, gated on whether the `tests` sub-block was parsed in compute-step 3:

   - **Three-row form (when a `tests` pair is present)**: render an impl / tests / total breakdown. Derive the **impl** pair as the render-time residual `impl = total − tests`, clamped per-component independently: `impl.added = max(0, total.added − tests.added)`, `impl.deleted = max(0, total.deleted − tests.deleted)`, `impl.net = max(0, total.net − tests.net)`. NEVER render a negative component (if any component would be negative, it has already been clamped to 0). Do NOT store `impl` anywhere — it is derived here only. Build `{COMMA_LIST_CODE}` by joining the ACTUAL `true_impact_exclude` config values with `, `, each wrapped in single backticks (e.g., `` `fab/`, `docs/` ``) — never hardcode the exclude names. Use the Unicode minus `−` (U+2212), not ASCII `-`. Render:
     ```
     **Impact**:
       impl:  +{impl.added}/−{impl.deleted}  (net +{impl.net})
       tests: +{tests.added}/−{tests.deleted}  (net +{tests.net})
       total: +{total.added}/−{total.deleted}  (net +{total.net})  ← excludes {COMMA_LIST_CODE}
     ```
     The `total` row is the scaffolding-excluded number; the raw-with-fab/docs number is NOT shown. When `true_impact_exclude` is empty (no `excluding` sub-block), omit the `← excludes …` annotation entirely (the total then degenerates to raw — there is nothing to annotate).

   - **Single-line form (when no `tests` pair)**: collapse to today's single `total` line:
     ```
     **Impact**: +{total.added}/−{total.deleted} code (excluding `{COMMA_LIST_CODE}`) · +{raw.added}/−{raw.deleted} total
     ```
     where the `code` pair is the scaffolding-excluded total and the trailing `total` pair is the raw `added`/`deleted`. When `true_impact_exclude` is empty there is no separate `excluding` pass; render just `**Impact**: +{total.added}/−{total.deleted} total` without the `(excluding …)` clause.

   - If impact computation was skipped (no merge-base, total yielded `+0/−0`, `fab impact` failed/empty, or `{has_fab}` is false): omit the entire `**Impact**:` line. The body still renders the Meta table and Pipeline line.

   **Summary text**: 1–3 sentences. Source:
   - If `{has_fab}` AND `{has_intake}`: derive from intake's `## Why` section.
   - Otherwise: auto-generate from commit messages or `git diff --stat`.

   **Changes bullets**: Bulleted list. Source:
   - If `{has_fab}` AND `{has_intake}`: subsection headings from intake's `## What Changes` section.
   - Otherwise: omit the `## Changes` section entirely.

   Print after body assembly: `  ✓ body  — meta + summary + changes` (skip "impact" / "issues" tokens when those lines were omitted).

4. Create PR: `gh pr create --draft --title "{pr_title}" --body "<body>"` (where `{pr_title}` is the already-prefixed title from step 2; `<body>` is the assembled body from step 3 including the Meta block when `{has_fab}`)
   - If PR creation fails → report the error and STOP
   - Fall back to `gh pr create --draft --fill` if body generation fails for any reason (silent fallback)
5. Get the PR URL: `gh pr view --json url -q '.url'`

Print: `  ✓ pr     — <PR URL>`

**If PR already exists** (from Step 1), just print: `  ✓ pr     — <existing PR URL> (existing)`

### Step 4a: Record PR URL

After the PR URL is known (from step 3c or from the existing PR in step 1), attempt to record it in the active change's `.status.yaml`:

1. Resolve the active change: `fab change resolve 2>/dev/null`
2. If resolution succeeds (exit 0), call: `fab status add-pr <name> <pr_url>`
3. If resolution fails (exit non-zero), skip silently — do not print any error or warning

This step MUST NOT block or fail the PR workflow. Any error is silently ignored.

### Step 4b: Finish Ship Stage

If an active change was resolved in Step 0a and `progress.ship` was started (not already `done`):

```bash
fab status finish <change> ship git-pr 2>/dev/null || true
```

This marks `ship` as `done` and auto-activates `review-pr`. Best-effort — failures silently ignored.

### Step 4c: Commit and Push Status Update

If Step 4a successfully recorded a PR URL (changeman resolved and statusman add-pr ran):

1. Stage the status and history files: `git add fab/changes/{name}/.status.yaml fab/changes/{name}/.history.jsonl`
2. Check for changes: `git diff --cached --quiet`
3. If changes exist: commit (`git commit -m "Update ship status and record PR URL"`) and push (`git push`). If commit or push fails → report the error and STOP.
4. If no changes (already committed): skip commit+push silently

Print (if committed): `  ✓ status — committed and pushed status updates (.status.yaml, .history.jsonl)`

If Step 4a was skipped (no active change, changeman not found), skip this step silently.

### Step 5: Report

Print:
```

Shipped.
```

## Rules

- Fully autonomous — never ask questions, never present options
- Fail fast — if any step fails, report the error and stop immediately
- Skip steps that are already done (no uncommitted → skip commit, PR exists → skip create)
- Always operate on CWD — no repo detection
- No merge support — stop at PR creation
