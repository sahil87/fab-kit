# Fab CLI Reference

> Loaded selectively via a skill's `helpers: [_cli-fab]` frontmatter. See `_preamble.md` § Common fab Commands for the 6 most-used commands (`preflight`, `score`, `log command`, `change`, `resolve`, `status`). This file documents the remaining commands and exhaustive flag details.

---

## Calling Convention

`fab <command> <subcommand> [args...]`. `fab` is a router dispatching workspace commands (`init`, `upgrade-repo`, `sync`, `update`, `doctor`) to `fab-kit` and everything else to the per-version `fab-go` binary resolved from `fab_version` in `fab/project/config.yaml`. `--version`/`-v`/`--help`/`-h`/`help` are handled inline. `fab-go` auto-fetches from GitHub releases on cache miss.

`fab -h` composes help from both binaries. `fab --version` prints the system binary version; inside a fab repo a second line shows the project-pinned version.

### `<change>` Argument

All commands accept the unified `<change>`: 4-char ID (`yobi`), folder substring (`fix-kit`), or full folder name (`260227-yobi-fix-kit-scripts`). Bare directory paths and `.status.yaml` paths are NOT accepted.

### Commands covered in `_preamble` Common fab Commands

`fab preflight`, `fab score`, `fab log command`, `fab change`, `fab resolve`, `fab status` — headline coverage lives there. Sections below document the remaining commands (`fab hook`, `fab pane`, `fab doctor`, `fab kit-path`, `fab impact`, `fab pr-meta`, `fab fab-help`, `fab help-dump`, `fab operator`, `fab spawn-command`, `fab batch`) and extended flag details for the above.

---

## fab change (extended subcommand details)

See `_preamble.md` § Common fab Commands for the headline. Full subcommand table:

| Subcommand | Usage | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `new` | `new --slug <slug> [--change-id <4char>] [--log-args <desc>]` | Create new change |
| `rename` | `rename --folder <current-folder> --slug <new-slug>` | Rename slug (prefix immutable) |
| `resolve` | `resolve [<override>]` | Passthrough to `fab resolve --folder` |
| `switch` | `switch <name> \| --none` | Switch active change (writes `.fab-status.yaml` symlink) |
| `list` | `list [--archive]` | List changes with stage info |
| `archive` | `archive <change> [--description "..."]` | Move to `archive/`, update index, mark backlog item done, clear pointer. `--description` is optional — defaults to the intake title (humanized-slug fallback). Re-archiving an already-archived change is a soft skip (exit 0). |
| `restore` | `restore <change> [--switch]` | Move from `archive/`, remove index entry, optionally activate |
| `archive-list` | `archive-list` | List archived folder names |

`archive` and `restore` output structured YAML to stdout — skills parse it for user-facing reports. The `archive` YAML adds a `backlog: {marked|already|not_found}` field alongside `action`, `name`, `move`, `index`, and `pointer`. **Exception**: on the soft-skip path (re-archiving an already-archived change), `archive` prints a plain `already archived: {change}` line instead of YAML and exits 0 — skills parsing stdout must handle this non-YAML case (the `/fab-archive` skill treats it as a clean no-op).

---

## fab status (extended subcommand details)

Full subcommand table (headline in `_preamble` § Common fab Commands):

| Subcommand | Usage | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| `finish` | `finish <change> <stage> [driver]` | Done + auto-activate next. Review auto-logs `passed` |
| `start` | `start <change> <stage> [driver] [from] [reason]` | pending/failed → active |
| `advance` | `advance <change> <stage> [driver]` | active → ready |
| `reset` | `reset <change> <stage> [driver] [from] [reason]` | done/ready/skipped → active (cascades downstream to pending) |
| `skip` | `skip <change> <stage> [driver]` | {pending,active} → skipped (cascades pending→skipped downstream) |
| `fail` | `fail <change> <stage> [driver] [rework]` | active → failed (review only). Auto-logs `failed` |
| `set-change-type` | `set-change-type <change> <type>` | |
| `set-acceptance` | `set-acceptance <change> <field> <value>` | Updates `plan:` block. Valid fields: `generated` (bool), `task_count`, `acceptance_count`, `acceptance_completed` (int) |
| `set-checklist` | `set-checklist [args...]` | **Removed** — exits 1 with `"set-checklist" is now "set-acceptance" — run fab status set-acceptance instead.` Use `set-acceptance` |
| `set-confidence` | `set-confidence <change> <counts...> <score> [--indicative]` | Basic confidence block. `--indicative` is a deprecated accepted-but-ignored no-op (1.10.0) — it writes nothing |
| `set-confidence-fuzzy` | `set-confidence-fuzzy <change> <counts...> <score> <dims...> [--indicative]` | With SRAD dimensions. `--indicative` is a deprecated no-op (see above) |
| `add-issue` / `get-issues` | `<change> <id>` / `<change>` | Issue ID array — idempotent / one per line |
| `add-pr` / `get-prs` | `<change> <url>` / `<change>` | PR URL array — idempotent / one per line |
| `progress-line` | `progress-line <change>` | Single-line visual progress |
| `current-stage` | `current-stage <change>` | Detect active stage |

**Side effects of `finish`**: `intake→apply`, `apply→review`, `review→hydrate` (+auto-log `passed`), `hydrate→ship`, `ship→review-pr`. Never call `start` after `finish`. Legacy `tasks` event invocations exit 1 with `"tasks" stage was removed — run "fab status <event> <change> apply" instead. plan.md is now generated at apply entry.` Legacy `spec` event invocations exit 1 with `"spec" stage was removed — spec.md is now generated at apply entry. Use "apply".`

**Auto-logs**: `finish review`→`passed`; `fail review`→`failed`; every `active` transition is best-effort logged. Skills do NOT manually call `fab log review` or `fab log transition`.

---

## fab score (extended)

See `_preamble.md` § Common fab Commands. Modes:

| Mode | Usage | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| Normal | `fab score <change>` | Parse `intake.md` (the sole scoring source; `--stage` defaults to `intake`), compute, write `.status.yaml`. No `indicative` key is written (retired 1.10.0) |
| Gate | `fab score --check-gate <change>` | Read-only, threshold compare, non-zero below threshold |
| Intake gate | `fab score --check-gate --stage intake <change>` | Flat threshold 3.0 for all types (the single gate) |

---

## fab preflight (extended)

`fab preflight [<change-name>]` — validates config.yaml, constitution.md, active change resolution, `.status.yaml` existence. Outputs YAML with `name`, `change_dir`, `stage`, `progress`, `plan`, `confidence`. Non-zero exit on failure (error on stderr). Pure validation — no side effects.

---

## fab log (extended)

Append-only JSON logging to `.history.jsonl`.

```
fab log command <cmd> [change] [args]
fab log confidence <change> <score> <delta> <trigger>
fab log review <change> <result> [rework]
fab log transition <change> <stage> <action> [from] [reason] [driver]
```

`command` resolves active change from `.fab-status.yaml` when `[change]` omitted; exits 0 silently if resolution fails (dangling/absent symlink). When `[change]` IS provided and doesn't resolve → exits 1.

**Common callers** — skills per `_preamble.md` Context Loading §2 (`fab log command "<skill>" "<change>"`); `finish/fail review` auto-log; `score` auto-logs confidence; `change new`/`change rename` auto-log.

---

## fab resolve (extended)

Pure query, no side effects.

```
fab resolve [--id|--folder|--dir|--status|--pane] [<change>]
```

| Flag | Output |
|------|--------|
| `--id` (default) | 4-char change ID |
| `--folder` | Full folder name |
| `--dir` | Directory path (`fab/changes/.../`) |
| `--status` | `.status.yaml` path |
| `--pane` | Tmux pane ID (requires `$TMUX`; errors if no matching pane) |

---

## fab hook

Claude Code hook handlers. Each subcommand is registered as inline `fab hook <subcommand>` in `.claude/settings.local.json`. **All hook subcommands exit 0** — errors silently swallowed so they never block the agent.

| Subcommand | Event | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `session-start` | SessionStart | Delete `_agents[session_id]` entry in `.fab-runtime.yaml` |
| `stop` | Stop | Write `_agents[session_id]` with `idle_since` plus optional tmux/pid/change/transcript fields |
| `user-prompt` | UserPromptSubmit | Remove only `idle_since` from `_agents[session_id]`; other fields preserved |
| `artifact-write` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Per-artifact bookkeeping from stdin JSON |
| `sync` | n/a | Register inline hook entries in `.claude/settings.local.json`; migrates old-style bash scripts; idempotent |

The three session-scoped hooks (`session-start`, `stop`, `user-prompt`) read a JSON payload on stdin with at least a `session_id` field (UUID) and optionally `transcript_path`. Malformed JSON or a missing `session_id` is silently skipped. Each handler also invokes a throttled GC sweep (≤ once per 180 s via `last_run_gc`) that prunes entries whose stored `pid` no longer exists (`kill(pid, 0)` returning ESRCH). `artifact-write` is unchanged — it parses a different payload shape (`tool_input.file_path`) and does not participate in `_agents` writes; it emits `{"additionalContext":"Bookkeeping: ..."}` on stdout.

`sync` output: `Created`, `Updated`, or `.claude/settings.local.json hooks: OK`.

---

## fab pane

Tmux pane operations with fab context enrichment. `fab pane <map|capture|send|process> [flags...]`

**Persistent flag** (all subcommands): `--server <name>` / `-L <name>` (default `""`) — target tmux socket (`tmux -L <name>`). Defaults to `$TMUX` / tmux default. Lets daemons on one tmux server inspect panes on another.

### map — `fab pane map [--json] [--session <name>] [--all-sessions] [--server <name>]`

All tmux panes with pipeline state. Non-git/non-fab panes included with `---` fallbacks.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | JSON array (snake_case: `session`, `window_index`, `pane`, `tab`, `worktree`, `repo`, `change`, `stage`, `agent_state`, `agent_idle_duration`, `pr_url`, `pr_number`). `repo` is the absolute main-worktree root for the pane's repo (`null` when unresolved) — `--json` only, no human-table column. `pr_url` (`string\|null`) is the last entry of the change's `.status.yaml` `prs:` list (most recent), `null` when the list is absent/empty or the pane has no resolvable change; `pr_number` (`number\|null`) is parsed from the URL's trailing `/pull/<n>` segment, `null` when there is no URL or it is unparseable. Both are `--json` only (no table column), sourced from the already-loaded status file — **no `gh`/`git`, no network, no PR status (open/merged/CI)**; consumers fetch live PR state themselves. |
| `--session <name>` | Target specific session (skips `$TMUX` check) |
| `--all-sessions` | Query all sessions (skips `$TMUX` check; mutually exclusive with `--session`) |

Without `--session`/`--all-sessions` → current session only (`-s` scope, requires `$TMUX`). Table columns: `Session` (only with `--all-sessions`), `Pane`, `WinIdx`, `Tab`, `Worktree` (relative; `(main)` for main; `basename/` non-git), `Change`, `Stage`, `Agent`. The `Worktree` relative path is computed **per repo** — each pane's display path is relative to its own repo's main-worktree root (cached by git worktree root), so panes from multiple repos render correct paths. Agent: `active`, `idle ({dur})`, or `—` (em dash). Change: folder name, `(no change)` for fab worktree with no active change, or `—` for non-fab panes. Idle duration: `{N}s`/`{N}m`/`{N}h` floor division. Change and Agent resolve on independent axes: Change comes from `.fab-status.yaml`; Agent comes from `_agents[*].tmux_pane` matching in `.fab-runtime.yaml` — so a pane with a running Claude in discussion mode (no active change) now shows `(no change)` in Change but a populated Agent column. `$TMUX` unset without targeting flag → exit 1. No panes → exit 0 `No tmux panes found.`

### capture — `fab pane capture <pane> [-l N] [--json] [--raw] [--server <name>]`

`<pane>` required (e.g., `%5`). `-l/--lines N` (default 50). `--json` = content + metadata (`worktree`/`change`/`stage`/`agent_state`/`agent_idle_duration`). `--raw` = plain `tmux capture-pane -p`, no enrichment. `--json`/`--raw` mutually exclusive. Pane not found → exit 1.

### send — `fab pane send <pane> <text> [--no-enter] [--force] [--server <name>]`

Validation pipeline: (1) pane exists via `tmux list-panes -a`; (2) agent is idle (rejects `active`/`unknown` unless `--force`); (3) `tmux send-keys`. `--no-enter` skips the trailing Enter. `--force` bypasses idle check only — pane-existence still enforced. Agent resolution matches `_agents[*].tmux_pane` in `.fab-runtime.yaml` at the worktree root; a pane with no matching entry = `unknown` (non-idle). Change state is independent — panes in discussion mode (no active change) now accept sends when idle, instead of being rejected as `unknown`. Success: `Sent to <pane>`.

### process — `fab pane process <pane> [--json] [--server <name>]`

OS-level process tree. Linux: walks `/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children`, reads `/proc/<pid>/comm` + `/cmdline`. macOS: `ps -o pid,ppid,comm -ax` PPID traversal, `ps -o args= -p <pid>` for full cmdline. Classification: `claude`/`claude-code` → `agent`, `node` → `node`, `git`/`gh` → `git`, else `other`. JSON: `{pane, pane_pid, processes (tree), has_agent}`. Pane not found → exit 1. `--server` scopes tmux lookup only; `/proc`/`ps` walk is socket-independent.

---

## fab doctor

Prerequisite check. Lives in `fab-kit` so it works before `config.yaml` exists; used as `/fab-setup` Phase 0 gate.

```
fab doctor [--porcelain]
```

**Checks** (7): git, fab, bash, yq (v4+), jq, gh, direnv (with zsh/bash hook detection).

**Output**: `  ✓ {tool} {version}` (pass) / `  ✗ {tool} — not found` + install hint (fail) / summary line. Exit code = failure count.

`--porcelain`: errors only (no passes/hints/summary). Exit code still = failure count. Empty stdout + exit 0 = all good.

---

## fab migrations-status

Migration discovery. Lives in `fab-kit` (registered in the router's `fabKitArgs` allowlist). Resolves `fab/.kit-migration-version` (local) and the engine `VERSION` from the cached kit for `fab_version`, scans the engine `migrations/` dir, and runs the discovery algorithm. Consumed by both `/fab-setup migrations` (via `--json`) and as a standalone query.

```
fab migrations-status [--json]
```

**Human output**: `Local version` / `Engine version`, then either `No migrations apply.` or `Migrations to apply (N):` with an ordered `[i/N] FROM -> TO (file)` list, followed by any gap-skip lines and any overlap warning.

**`--json` output**: `{local, engine, applicable:[{from,to,file}], gap_skips, overlaps}` — `applicable` is the ordered chain to apply (FROM ascending), `gap_skips` are skip log lines, `overlaps` are conflicting filename pairs (non-empty = malformed migration set).

**Exit code**: `0` on any clean query — including the no-op case AND the overlap case (overlap is surfaced via the `overlaps` field). Non-zero only on a genuine error (missing `fab/.kit-migration-version`, missing engine `VERSION`, unreadable migrations dir). Read-only — never writes `fab/.kit-migration-version`.

---

## fab kit-path

```
fab kit-path
```

Prints absolute path to the resolved kit directory (exe-sibling `kit/` next to `fab-go`). No trailing newline, no decoration. Exit 0 on success; non-zero with stderr error on failure. Used by skills to reference kit content: `$(fab kit-path)/templates/`, `$(fab kit-path)/migrations/`, etc.

---

## fab impact

```
fab impact <base> <head>
```

Computes `git diff --shortstat <base>...<head>` line counts and emits a YAML document on stdout matching the `.status.yaml` `true_impact` block schema (minus `computed_at_stage`):

```yaml
added: 142
deleted: 38
net: 104
excluding:
    added: 87
    deleted: 38
    net: 49
tests:
    added: 40
    deleted: 0
    net: 40
computed_at: "2026-05-07T14:32:00Z"
```

The `excluding` sub-block is emitted only when `fab/project/config.yaml`'s top-level `true_impact_exclude` list is non-empty; the subcommand applies each entry as a `:(exclude)<pattern>` pathspec when running the second `git diff --shortstat` pass.

The `tests` sub-block is emitted only when `fab/project/config.yaml`'s top-level `test_paths` list is non-empty. It is computed by a third `git diff --shortstat` pass whose pathspec combines the `test_paths` includes with the same `:(exclude)<pattern>` arguments as the `excluding` pass — so test lines are counted *within the scaffolding-excluded universe* (a test fixture under an excluded path is not double-counted). Each include is applied as a `:(glob)<pattern>` magic pathspec so wildcards behave like `.gitignore`-style globs — notably `**` matches across directory boundaries (so `**/*_test.go` matches both `foo_test.go` and `pkg/foo_test.go`). When `true_impact_exclude` is empty, the test pass runs with the includes alone (tests are then attributed within the raw universe). No `impl` field is emitted: the implementation residual (`impl = max(0, total − tests)`, per component) is derived at render time by consumers — the YAML stores only the measured passes. Emitted after `excluding`, before `computed_at`.

Three-dot range semantics (`<base>...<head>`) — "changes on this branch only".

Exit codes:
- `0` — success; YAML document on stdout.
- non-zero — `<base>` is empty/invalid or `git diff` failed; actionable message on stderr (e.g., `base ref is empty`). The subcommand does not run `git merge-base` itself — callers must resolve the merge-base upstream and pass the result. The caller decides whether to abort or skip.

Consumers: `fab pr-meta` (which renders the PR body `**Impact**` line via the same `internal/impact` package) and the apply-finish + hydrate-finish hooks (write the result into `.status.yaml` `true_impact`). `/git-pr` no longer calls `fab impact` directly — it delegates the whole `## Meta` block to `fab pr-meta`.

---

## fab pr-meta

```
fab pr-meta <change> --type <type> [--issues "DEV-1 DEV-2"]
```

Renders the complete `## Meta` block of a fab-generated PR as final markdown on stdout — the deterministic replacement for the natural-language Meta formatting that previously lived in `/git-pr` Step 3c. The block is byte-for-byte stable across runs, so the Meta block stops drifting between PRs.

Arguments and flags:
- `<change>` — 4-char ID, folder substring, or full folder name (resolved via the same `resolve` package as every other subcommand).
- `--type <type>` — **required**. The resolved PR type (`feat|fix|refactor|docs|test|ci|chore`). `/git-pr` resolves type via its Step 0b chain (which depends on the user's argument and the diff) and passes it in; the binary does not re-derive it.
- `--issues "<space-joined IDs>"` — optional. When non-empty, renders the `**Issues**` line. When absent/empty, the line is omitted.

Self-contained data sourcing — the command reads everything else itself:
- `.status.yaml` (via the `statusfile` package): `id`, `confidence.score`, `plan.acceptance_count`/`acceptance_completed`, `progress.*`, `stage_metrics.review.iterations`.
- `plan.md`: parses the `## Tasks` checkboxes (`- [x]` vs `- [ ]`) for the `{done}/{total} tasks` count. Legacy `tasks.md` fallback for pre-1.9.0 changes.
- `fab/project/config.yaml`: `true_impact_exclude`, `test_paths`, and `project.linear_workspace`.
- Impact math: reuses `internal/impact` (`ComputeForRepo`) against the merge-base of HEAD vs `origin/main` (falling back to `origin/master`), computed internally.
- Git/`gh` context: branch (`git branch --show-current`) and owner/repo (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`) for blob URLs.

Output — the exact `## Meta` block markdown:
- The 5-column table (`ID | Type | Confidence | Plan | Review`) with `—` fallbacks, a ` ✓` Plan completion suffix when both task and acceptance pairs are complete, and a `✓/✗ {N} cycle{s}` Review cell.
- `**Pipeline**`: the six stages in fixed order with ` ✓` per `done` stage; `intake`/`apply` labels hyperlink to blob URLs when the artifact exists and owner/repo resolved.
- `**Issues**` (only when `--issues` is non-empty): Linear-linked when `project.linear_workspace` is set, bare comma-joined IDs otherwise; positioned between Pipeline and Impact.
- `**Impact**`: three-row impl/tests/total form when a `tests` pair exists (impl is the per-component `max(0, total − tests)` residual, Unicode minus `−`, `← excludes` annotation built from the actual `true_impact_exclude` values each backtick-wrapped), single-line form otherwise; omitted entirely on `+0/−0` total, missing merge-base, or impact failure.

Exit codes:
- `0` — success; the `## Meta` block on stdout.
- non-zero — no fab context (change unresolved or `.status.yaml` absent); nothing on stdout. `/git-pr` treats this (or empty stdout) as "omit the Meta block", matching the legacy `{has_fab} = false` path.

Graceful degradation: an unreachable `gh` leaves owner/repo empty so Pipeline stages render as plain-text labels (never a hard error); a missing/failed merge-base drops only the `**Impact**` line.

Consumers: `/git-pr` Step 3c (renders the PR body `## Meta` block, pasted verbatim).

---

## fab memory-index

```
fab memory-index [--check]
```

Deterministically (re)generates the `docs/memory/` index files so agents never hand-edit
them — the deterministic replacement for the hand-maintained index rows that previously lived
in the hydrate / `docs-reorg-memory` skill prose. Modeled on `fab pr-meta` (pure
`RenderRoot`/`RenderDomain` + a `Gather` I/O orchestrator in `internal/memoryindex`), so the
output is byte-for-byte stable across runs and stops the per-row merge conflicts on the hot
`description` / `Last Updated` cells.

What it writes:
- **Root `docs/memory/index.md`** — **domains-only** (`| Domain | Description |`). The legacy
  inlined per-file "Memory Files" column is dropped (it silently drifts). Each domain row's
  Description is read from that domain `index.md`'s `description:` frontmatter.
- **Every `docs/memory/{domain}/index.md`** — file rows (`| File | Description | Last Updated |`)
  for each non-`index` `.md` file, plus a `description:` frontmatter line carrying the domain's
  curated one-liner (round-tripped so the root row survives regen). When the domain contains
  sub-domains, a `## Sub-Domains` table is appended referencing each (`[sub](sub/index.md)`) —
  emitted only when sub-domains exist, so a flat domain index is byte-identical to before.
- **Every `docs/memory/{domain}/{sub-domain}/index.md`** — a sub-domain is a folder one level
  under a domain dir holding ≥1 non-`index` `.md`. It gets its own generated index using the
  same file-row contract as a domain index (relative `[file](file.md)` links are correct from
  the sub-domain folder). Recursion is one level only: `{domain}/{sub-domain}/{topic}.md`
  (depth 3, the max bound). Deeper nesting is surfaced as a depth warning, not an extra index
  tier. An empty sub-folder (no `.md`) is skipped — no spurious index.

Data sourcing (all read by the command itself):
- Each topic file's **H1** (first `# ` line) and **`description:` frontmatter** (via
  `internal/frontmatter`). A file with no `description:` renders `—` in that cell (never errors).
- **"Last Updated"** from `git log -1 --date=short --format=%ad -- <file>`, run at the repo
  root. Degrades to `—` when git returns nothing — uncommitted file, worktree, shallow clone,
  squash/rebase, or git unavailable — mirroring how `fab pr-meta` degrades on missing git/gh
  context.

Shape warnings (non-fatal, stderr — the "detect" half of the memory-tree-shape work):
- `⚠ docs/memory/<domain> has <N> topic files (soft bound: ~12) — consider splitting into sub-domains`
  when a folder holds more than ~12 topic files.
- `⚠ docs/memory/<domain>/<sub>/<deep> exceeds depth 3 — consider flattening` when nesting
  exceeds 3 levels under `docs/memory/`.
- Reserved domains **`_shared/`** and **`_unsorted/`** are **exempt** from the width warning.
- Warnings are advisory: they never block, never modify files, and never affect the byte-stable
  index output (so a regen-with-warnings is still idempotent).

Flags:
- `--check` — write nothing; exit non-zero (listing the out-of-date files on stderr) if any
  index file differs from what would be generated. Useful as a staleness guard (CI / preflight).

Exit codes:
- `0` — success (indexes written or already up to date; `--check` clean).
- non-zero — `docs/memory/` not found, a write failed, or (`--check`) an index is out of date.

Consumers: the hydrate skills (`/docs-hydrate-memory` Step 4, `/fab-continue` hydrate) and
`/docs-reorg-memory` (index regen after diagnosis) — all call `fab memory-index` instead of
hand-maintaining index rows.

---

## fab fab-help

```
fab fab-help
```

Scans skill frontmatter from the cache kit, groups skills by category (Start & Navigate, Planning, Completion, Maintenance, Setup, Batch Operations), renders formatted overview. Excludes `_`-prefix and `internal-` prefix skills. Batch entries read dynamically from `fab batch` cobra subcommands. Unmapped → "Other".

Output: version header, workflow diagram, grouped commands, typical flow, packages section (wt, idea).

(The command name is `fab-help` — not overriding cobra's built-in `help`.)

---

## fab help-dump

```
fab help-dump
```

**Hidden, CI/build-time-only command.** Marked `Hidden: true`, so it does not appear in `fab --help` and is excluded from its own dumped tree. Takes no arguments. Walks the live cobra command tree of the rich `fab` CLI programmatically (not by regex-parsing `-h` text) and writes the frozen shll.ai "command reference" contract JSON to stdout.

Contract shape (`schema_version: 1`):

```json
{
  "tool": "fab",
  "version": "<main.version, from ldflags>",
  "captured_at": "<RFC3339 UTC>",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "root": {
    "name": "fab",
    "path": "fab",
    "short": "...",
    "usage": "...",
    "text": "<raw -h body, byte-for-byte>",
    "commands": [ /* recursive Node[]; [] for a leaf, never null */ ]
  }
}
```

Per node: `name=cmd.Name()`, `path=cmd.CommandPath()`, `short=cmd.Short`, `usage=cmd.UseLine()`, `text=cmd.UsageString()`. At every level the walk drops `completion`, `help`, and any `Hidden` command, then sorts surviving children by `Name()` for byte-stable output. JSON is 2-space indented with HTML escaping disabled, so `<`, `>`, `&` in help text are preserved verbatim.

`tool` is the literal `"fab"` (the user-facing binary); the *output file* is named `help/fab-kit.json` (the repo/site slug) — these intentionally differ. Consumed by `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Help-dump → shll.ai step) to deliver an auto-merging PR into `sahil87/shll.ai`.

## fab operator

```
fab operator
```

Singleton tmux-tab launcher for `/fab-operator`. Requires `$TMUX`. If window `operator` exists → select it (`Switched to existing operator tab.`); else create one in the repo root running `{spawn_command} '/fab-operator'` (`Launched operator.`).

**Spawn command resolution**: `agent.spawn_command` from `fab/project/config.yaml`; falls back to `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` if missing/null/empty.

### fab operator tick-start

```
fab operator tick-start
```

Called at start of each operator tick. Increments `tick_count`, writes `last_tick_at` (ISO 8601 UTC) to the **server-keyed** state file (not the old repo-rooted `.fab-operator.yaml`). Stdout:

```
tick: N
now: HH:MM
```

**State path** (server-keyed, XDG): `<XDG_STATE_HOME>/fab/operator/<server-slug>.yaml`, where the base is `$XDG_STATE_HOME` (when set and absolute) else `$HOME/.local/state` — uniform on Linux and macOS (never `~/Library/...`). `<server-slug>` is derived from the tmux socket path (`#{socket_path}`) by escaping literal `-` to `--` then mapping separators to a single `-` (e.g. `/tmp/tmux-1000/default` → `tmp-tmux--1000-default`); the escape keeps the mapping collision-free so distinct sockets never share a state file. One operator-per-tmux-server gets one state file that survives a server restart (same `-L` label → same socket path). Falls back to slug `default` when tmux can't be queried. No migration of old repo-rooted `.fab-operator.yaml` files — they are abandoned in place.

### fab operator time

```
fab operator time [--interval <duration>]
```

Pure time query (no writes).

- Without `--interval`: `now: HH:MM`
- With `--interval 3m`: `now: HH:MM\nnext: HH:MM` (now + interval)

Duration is Go format (`3m`, `5m`, `2m`). Invalid → exit 1.

## fab spawn-command

```
fab spawn-command [--repo <path>]
```

Prints a repo's configured agent spawn command to stdout. With `--repo <path>`, reads `agent.spawn_command` from `<path>/fab/project/config.yaml`; without `--repo`, resolves the current repo's config via upward `fab/` search (same source as `fab operator`). Falls back to `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` when the key is missing/empty or the file is unreadable. Lets the operator fetch a **target** repo's spawn command (e.g. to spawn an agent into a different repo with that repo's configuration) instead of only its own.

## fab batch

Multi-target operations: `fab batch <new|switch|archive> [--list] [--all] [targets...]`. The `new` and `switch` subcommands create tmux windows and require `$TMUX`; `archive` runs in-process and does not.

- **`new`** — parse `fab/backlog.md` pending items (`- [ ] [xxxx]`), create worktrees, open tmux windows, start agents with `/fab-new {description}`. No args → `--list`. IDs → one worktree tab each (`wt create --non-interactive --worktree-name {id}`, window `fab-{id}`, `{spawn_command} '/fab-new {description}'`). `--all` → all pending. Handles continuation lines.
- **`switch`** — resolve change names, create worktrees with branch names (applying `branch_prefix` from config), start agents with `/fab-switch {change}`. No args → `--list`. `--all` → all active changes (excludes `archive/`). Branch naming: `{branch_prefix}{folder_name}`.
- **`archive`** — find changes with `hydrate: done|skipped`, then archive each mechanically in a Go loop via `internal/archive.ArchiveWithBacklog` (move, index, backlog mark-done, pointer). No agent or Claude session is spawned; resolution uses `resolve.ToFolder` (no `fab`-on-PATH dependency). No args → `--all` (differs from new/switch). `--list` → show archivable only. Per change prints `{name} — archived` (with ` (backlog marked done)` when applicable), `already archived, skipping`, or `FAILED: {err}`; a single failure never aborts the batch. Footer: `Archived {N}, skipped {M}, failed {K}.`. Exits non-zero only when `failed > 0`.

## Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Status file not found: {path}` | Passed a path that doesn't exist | Use change ID or folder name |
| `Cannot resolve change '{arg}'` | ID/name matches no folder in `fab/changes/` | Check `fab change list` |
| `Multiple changes match` | Ambiguous substring matched multiple folders | Use a more specific identifier |
| `No active changes found` | `.fab-status.yaml` symlink absent and no changes exist | Run `/fab-new` or `/fab-draft` |
