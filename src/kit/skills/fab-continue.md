> Read the `_preamble` skill first (deployed to `.claude/skills/` via `fab sync`). Then follow its instructions before proceeding.

> **Stage-conditional helpers** (see `_preamble.md` § Skill Helper Declaration): `_generation` and `_review` are deliberately NOT in this skill's frontmatter `helpers:`. Read `.claude/skills/_generation/SKILL.md` only when generating an artifact (apply entry with no `plan.md`, or intake-`active` regeneration), and `.claude/skills/_review/SKILL.md` only when entering Review Behavior. Hydrate, ship, review-pr, and apply-resumes need neither.

## Purpose

Advance through the 6-stage Fab pipeline one step at a time. Each invocation handles the current stage's work and transitions to the next. When called with a stage argument, resets to that stage and re-runs from there.

> **Per-stage model (one-stage sequencer)**: post-intake `/fab-continue` is a **one-stage sequencer** — it dispatches its stage as a sub-agent (see Normal Flow Step 1) and resolves that stage's model once immediately before the dispatch. Mechanics in Step 1's dispatch contract; selection rules in `_preamble.md` § Subagent Dispatch → Per-Stage Model Resolution. Every post-intake stage runs dispatched, so the tier applies uniformly and is never merely advisory. (Intake is pre-boundary — it runs in the main session and is not tiered by `/fab-continue`.)

---

## Arguments

- **`<change-name>`** *(optional)* — target a specific change instead of the active one resolved via `.fab-status.yaml`. Passed to preflight as `$1` (see `_preamble.md` §2).
- **`<stage>`** *(optional)* — reset target: `intake`, `apply`, `review`, `hydrate`, `ship`, `review-pr`. The legacy `tasks` and `spec` targets error with a pointer to the `apply` and `intake` reset routes (see Error Handling).

Both may be provided in any order. Stage names are treated as reset targets; all others as change-name overrides.

---

## Pre-flight

1. Classify arguments: stage name vs. change-name override (stage names take priority)
2. Run preflight per `_preamble.md` §2
3. Use preflight's `stage` and `progress` fields for all subsequent logic

---

## Normal Flow

### Step 1: Determine Current Stage

Dispatch on preflight's derived `stage` and `display_state`. If progress is `pending`, run `fab status start <change> <stage> fab-continue` before dispatching. **Review-failed dispatch**: if `progress.review` is `failed` (an exhausted `/fab-ff`/`/fab-fff` rework loop, or an interrupted fail→reset sequence), do NOT re-run review — use the `review`/`failed` row below: present the rework menu directly. (Orchestrator re-runs of `/fab-ff`/`/fab-fff` instead recover via `fab status start <change> review` per `_pipeline.md` Resumability — that autonomous path is theirs, not this skill's.) **Review-pr-failed dispatch**: if `progress.review-pr` is `failed` (a failed PR-review run — `gh` missing, no PR found, or a processing error), use the `review-pr`/`failed` row below: re-execute `/git-pr-review` behavior — a FAILED PR review MUST NOT fall through to the "all `done`" row and read as complete.

**State-based dispatch**: Intake is the only planning stage, and the only stage `/fab-continue` runs in the main session. **Every post-intake stage (apply / review / hydrate) is dispatched as a sub-agent** — `/fab-continue` is a one-stage sequencer for those stages (full contract below). (Ship/review-pr delegate to `/git-pr` / `/git-pr-review`, which self-manage their transitions — see their rows.) The dispatch is the SAME one the orchestrators (`_pipeline.md`) perform; the sequencer/block split is identical whether the caller is manual `/fab-continue` or an orchestrator.

- **`ready`** (intake) → Finish intake (auto-activates apply), then run the apply sequencer (resolve + dispatch the apply sub-agent — its entry sub-step generates `plan.md`, then runs tasks — then finish apply)
- **`active`** (intake) → Generate intake if missing and advance to `ready` (backward compat for interrupted generations) — main session, no dispatch
- **`active`/`ready`** (post-intake execution) → resolve the stage's model, dispatch the stage's block as a sub-agent, then finish/fail/reset per the returned result

**Sub-agent dispatch contract (post-intake stages).** For apply / review / hydrate, before dispatching run `fab resolve-agent <stage> --alias` (the `--alias` flag emits the Agent-tool-valid short alias on the `model=` line), surface the resolved `model=/effort=/dispatch=` (so a skipped/mis-resolved tier — or a CLI dispatch — is visible), then **branch on `dispatch=` presence** (per `_preamble.md` § Subagent Dispatch → Per-Stage Model Resolution / § CLI-Adapter Dispatch): absent ⇒ **native Agent-tool dispatch** — model via the Agent `model` param (empty ⇒ omit/inherit), effort via an imperative instruction in the sub-agent's prompt (empty effort ⇒ omit; the Agent tool has no effort param); present ⇒ the **CLI adapter** (`fab dispatch`: start-on-stdin → `sleep 30` poll → five-state handling; the profile rides the `dispatch=` command so the Agent-tool seams do not apply; NO fallback to a session command; no cleanup after `done`). Dispatch a sub-agent (native: Agent tool, `general-purpose`; CLI: `fab dispatch`) to execute the named Behavior section *of this file* — a fresh-context run of that block, NOT a recursive `/fab-continue` invocation — and the prompt MUST carry the **block-contract carve-out** (do NOT run `fab status` **transition** commands `start`/`advance`/`finish`/`reset`/`fail`/`skip`; **DO** end with a terminal `fab status refresh`; return results only), the standard subagent context files, and the result obligation (both per `_preamble.md` § Dispatch-Prompt Obligations). The sequencer (this `/fab-continue` invocation) runs the `finish`/`fail`/`reset` transition after the sub-agent returns. This is the universal block contract — the block never owns its transitions, regardless of caller.

| Derived stage | State | Action |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| `intake` | `ready` | finish intake (auto-activates apply) → run the apply sequencer: `fab resolve-agent apply --alias` → dispatch the apply sub-agent (its entry sub-step generates `plan.md` — including its `## Requirements` — then runs tasks) → on success `finish <change> apply fab-continue` (auto-activates review) |
| `intake` | `active` | generate intake if missing (read `.claude/skills/_generation/SKILL.md` first — Intake Generation Procedure) → advance to `ready` (main session — no dispatch) |
| `apply` | `active`/`ready` | `fab resolve-agent apply --alias` → dispatch the apply sub-agent (entry: generate `plan.md` if absent; main: run tasks) → on completion run `finish <change> apply fab-continue` (auto-activates review) |
| `review` | `active`/`ready` | `fab resolve-agent review --alias` → read `change_type` from the change's `.status.yaml` (e.g. `grep '^change_type:' fab/changes/<change>/.status.yaml` — preflight does not emit it) and carry it in the block dispatch prompt (the review worker's parsimony/deletion-candidate skip condition keys on it) → dispatch the single review sub-agent (which reads `_review.md` at entry and runs the whole review inline) → it returns one unified findings set + pass/fail. Pass: run `finish <change> review fab-continue` (auto-activates hydrate). Fail: run `fail <change> review` then `reset <change> apply fab-continue`, then present the § Verdict rework menu (Path A) |
| `review` | `failed` | *(Keys on `progress.review == failed` via the guard above. Preflight does surface a parked failure — `display_stage`/`display_state` read `review`/`failed` via DisplayStage's failed tier — but the derived routing `stage` lands on the next pending stage, so the progress map is the reliable key.)* Run `reset <change> apply fab-continue` (the same post-fail reset the Verdict fail path runs — review cascades to `pending`, apply re-activates), then present the rework menu (Review Behavior § Verdict, **Fail** options table) directly and stop for the user's choice — do NOT re-run review first |
| `hydrate` | `active`/`ready` | `fab resolve-agent hydrate --alias` → dispatch the hydrate sub-agent → on success run `finish <change> hydrate fab-continue` |
| `ship` | `active` | *(`ready` is unreachable — ship's AllowedStates are `{pending, active, done, skipped}`.)* Execute `/git-pr` behavior **with the resolved change as the explicit `<change>` argument** (`/git-pr {name}` — transient override; its branch guard verifies the checked-out branch) → git-pr finishes ship internally (its Step 4b); only if the stage is still `active` after it returns, run `finish <change> ship fab-continue` (auto-activates review-pr) |
| `review-pr` | `active` | *(`ready` is unreachable — review-pr's AllowedStates are `{pending, active, done, failed, skipped}`.)* Execute `/git-pr-review` behavior **with the resolved change as the explicit `<change>` argument** (`/git-pr-review {name}` — same transient-override + branch-guard contract) → it routes all terminal paths through its Step 6 and runs its own transitions. Pass/no-reviews: only if the stage is still `active` after it returns, run `finish <change> review-pr fab-continue`. Timeout (Copilot review requested but not yet available): the stage is deliberately left `active` — report and stop, no re-finish. Fail: only if the stage is still `active` after it returns (its Step 6 normally runs `fail` itself), run `fail <change> review-pr` |
| `review-pr` | `failed` | *(Keys on `progress.review-pr == failed` via the guard above — the same progress-map mechanism as the `review`/`failed` row.)* Re-execute `/git-pr-review` behavior **with the resolved change as the explicit `<change>` argument** — its Step 0 runs `fab status start <change> review-pr`, and the CLI's review-pr `start` transition accepts `failed → active`; from there it routes terminal paths through its Step 6 with the same only-if-still-active guards as the row above. Do NOT route through `reset` — reset's From-set is `{done, ready, skipped}` (excludes `failed`); the CLI would error |
| all `done` | — | Block: "Change is complete." |

> **Dispatch shorthand (apply / review / hydrate rows).** In the rows above, "`fab resolve-agent <stage> --alias` → dispatch the … sub-agent" is the Sub-agent dispatch contract from Normal Flow Step 1: surface the resolved `model=/effort=/dispatch=`, then **branch on `dispatch=`** — absent ⇒ native Agent-tool dispatch (the two seams), present ⇒ the CLI adapter (`fab dispatch`, per `_preamble.md` § CLI-Adapter Dispatch). The dispatched block carries the block-contract carve-out (no `fab status` transition commands; terminal `fab status refresh`; return results only). The `finish`/`fail`/`reset` shown in each row is the **sequencer's** post-return transition, not the block's. (Ship / review-pr delegate to `/git-pr` / `/git-pr-review`, which self-manage their transitions — no `fab resolve-agent`/dispatch-adapter branch applies to them.)

### Step 2: Load Context

Load per `_preamble.md` layers. Stage-specific additions: intake loads memory files; apply loads intake + plan (if it already exists) + source code; review adds plan + memory; hydrate loads memory index + target files.

### Step 3: SRAD + Generation

**Intake only** (main session — the only non-dispatched stage): Apply SRAD (`_srad.md`, loaded via `helpers:`) before generating. Budget: 1-2 unresolved questions. Tentative decisions get `<!-- assumed: ... -->` markers. (Inside apply, under-specified requirements are resolved inline as graded SRAD assumptions in `plan.md` `## Assumptions` — not as questions or markers.)

**Post-intake stages** run their procedure **inside the dispatched sub-agent** (per the dispatch contract in Step 1), not in the sequencer: apply → [Apply Behavior](#apply-behavior) (entry reads `_generation.md` at point of use), review → [Review Behavior](#review-behavior) (reads `_review.md` at point of use), hydrate → [Hydrate Behavior](#hydrate-behavior). The sub-agent reads its Behavior section and any stage-conditional helper at its point of use.

**No scoring at any stage `/fab-continue` runs.** Intake scoring is authoritative and is performed by `/fab-new` / `/fab-clarify`; `/fab-continue` operates only at apply and later, where there is no scoring.

### Step 4: Update `.status.yaml`

Use event commands via CLI to update `.status.yaml`. The `finish` command handles the transition atomically: `fab status finish <change> <completed-stage> fab-continue` (sets `{completed}` → `done`, auto-activates the next pending stage, refreshes `last_updated` + `stage_metrics`).

For other state changes, use the appropriate event command (driver is always optional):
- `fab status start <change> <stage> fab-continue` — pending → active (plus failed → active for review/review-pr only)
- `fab status advance <change> <stage>` — active → ready
- `fab status fail <change> <stage>` — active → failed (review/review-pr only)
- `fab status reset <change> <stage> fab-continue` — done/ready/skipped → active (cascades downstream to pending)

### Step 5: Output

Display summary. Include Assumptions summary for planning stages. End with `Next:` per state table in `_preamble.md`.

## Apply Behavior

> **This section is the apply block — it always runs in a dispatched sub-agent** per the sub-agent dispatch contract in Normal Flow Step 1: the block runs no `fab status` command and returns results only; the sequencer owns the `finish`/`fail`/`reset` transitions. The `finish` steps below are the sequencer's, shown for the end-to-end picture.

Apply runs as **two sub-steps in a single dispatch**: a Plan Generation entry sub-step that produces `plan.md`, followed by the Task Execution main sub-step.

### Preconditions

- `intake.md` MUST exist (used as input to plan generation — requirements are derived from the intake design)

### Plan Generation (entry sub-step)

1. **If `plan.md` already exists** with at least a `## Tasks` heading: skip generation entirely. Resumability path — the existing plan is authoritative; user-edited entries are preserved. To force regeneration, the user MUST delete `plan.md` before re-running `/fab-continue`.
2. **Otherwise**: read `.claude/skills/_generation/SKILL.md` (if not already loaded), then invoke the **Plan Generation Procedure**. Write `plan.md` to the change folder. `fab status refresh` recomputes `plan.generated`, `plan.task_count`, and `plan.acceptance_count` on `.status.yaml`, self-healed at the next `advance`/`finish`/`preflight` — no manual call needed.
3. Apply MUST ignore the `## Acceptance` section during the main sub-step — that section is consumed by review.

### Pattern Extraction

Before executing the first unchecked task, read existing source files in the areas the change will touch and extract:

1. **Naming conventions** — variable/function/class naming style observed in surrounding code
2. **Error handling** — how the codebase handles errors (exceptions, Result types, error codes, etc.)
3. **Structure** — typical function length, module boundaries, import organization
4. **Reusable utilities** — existing helpers or shared modules that new code should use instead of reimplementing

Hold these patterns as context for all subsequent task execution within the same apply run.

If `fab/project/code-quality.md` exists, load its `## Principles` as additional implementation constraints alongside extracted patterns. If a `## Test Strategy` section is defined, it governs test timing (default: `test-alongside`).

**Skip on resume**: When resuming mid-apply (some tasks already `[x]`), pattern extraction is skipped — patterns are re-derived implicitly from reading task-relevant source files.

### Task Execution (main sub-step)

1. Parse the `## Tasks` section of `plan.md` — content between `## Tasks` and the next `## ` heading (typically `## Execution Order` or `## Acceptance`). The `## Acceptance` section is OUT OF SCOPE for apply.
2. If a top-level `## Execution Order` heading is present in `plan.md`, parse its body separately (content between `## Execution Order` and the next `## ` heading) and use it to constrain task ordering in step 4. If absent, infer ordering from phase/`[P]`-marker conventions alone.
3. Parse tasks: `- [ ]` = remaining, `- [x]` = skip
4. If all checked: return completion status (the sequencer runs `finish <change> apply` — the block runs no `fab status` command). Stop.
5. Execute in phase order; within phases, non-`[P]` sequential, `[P]` parallelizable. Respect Execution Order constraints parsed in step 2.
6. For each unchecked task:
   1. Read source files relevant to this task
   2. Implement per the plan's `## Requirements`, constitution, and extracted patterns
   3. Prefer reusing existing utilities over creating new ones
   4. Keep functions focused — if implementation exceeds the codebase's typical function size, consider extracting
   5. Write tests per `fab/project/code-quality.md` test strategy (default: `test-alongside`)
   6. Run tests, fix failures
   7. Mark `[x]` immediately
7. On completion: return completion status (or failure with task ID + reason). The sequencer runs `finish <change> apply fab-continue` (auto-activates review) after the block returns success.

### Resumability

Plan Generation sub-step is skipped when `plan.md` already exists (idempotent on file presence). Task Execution starts from the first unchecked item; checked items assumed complete.

---

## Review Behavior

> **This section is the review block — it always runs in a dispatched sub-agent** per the sub-agent dispatch contract in Normal Flow Step 1. **The dispatched review worker IS the single review agent**: it reads `_review.md` at entry and executes that file's Shared Review Dispatch inline itself — it does not dispatch any further sub-agent. Its job: review the diff and **return** pass/fail + prioritized must-fix / should-fix / nice-to-have findings. **Findings are the block's return value, not conversation.** It takes no §Verdict-style decision itself and never branches on caller. Who acts on a fail verdict is the orchestrator's concern: the interactive § Verdict menu below (Path A, run by the manual `/fab-continue` sequencer) or `_pipeline.md`'s autonomous Auto-Rework Loop (Paths B/C/D). The § Verdict transitions below are the sequencer's actions on the returned verdict.

The review worker reads `.claude/skills/_review/SKILL.md` (if not already loaded), then executes its **Shared Review Dispatch** end-to-end (Review Mode → Preconditions → Review Agent Dispatch → Findings & Verdict), running the whole review inline. The `_review.md` skill defines the merged procedure (plan-conformance steps + holistic-diff focus areas + Codex→Claude cascade), preconditions, structured output format, pass/fail rule, and the verbatim framing line the worker reads there — no separate prompt carrier is needed for the framing. The **`change_type`** input the parsimony/deletion-candidate skip condition keys on is supplied by the sequencer in the block dispatch prompt (see Normal Flow Step 1's review dispatch), not read by this block.

### Verdict

> Verdict transitions are the **sequencer's** (manual `/fab-continue`, Path A), not the dispatched block's. In Paths B/C/D the orchestrator's Auto-Rework Loop (`_pipeline.md`) takes the equivalent actions autonomously.

**Pass**: Run `fab status finish <change> review fab-continue` (auto-activates hydrate). Update acceptance progress via `fab status set-acceptance <change> acceptance_completed <N>`. Output report + `Next: {per state table}`.

**Fail** (manual rework — Path A, the `/fab-continue` sequencer): Run `fab status fail <change> review` then `fab status reset <change> apply fab-continue`. Update acceptance progress via `fab status set-acceptance <change> acceptance_completed <N>`. Present the returned findings with priority annotations, then offer rework options:

| Option | When | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Fix code | Implementation bug (must-fix / should-fix items) | Uncheck affected tasks in `plan.md` `## Tasks` with `<!-- rework: {reason} -->`, run `/fab-continue` |
| Revise plan | Missing/wrong tasks or acceptance items | Edit `plan.md` directly, run `/fab-continue` |
| Revise requirements | Requirements wrong | Edit `plan.md` `## Requirements` plus the downstream `## Tasks`/`## Acceptance` it affects, then re-run `/fab-continue` (apply). For a fundamentally wrong intake, run `/fab-continue intake` first (resets to intake and regenerates it), refine via `/fab-clarify`, and delete `plan.md` so apply re-derives `## Requirements` from the revised intake. |

The applying agent triages review comments by priority — not all comments need to be implemented. Must-fix items are always addressed. Should-fix items are addressed when clear and low-effort. Nice-to-have items may be acknowledged but deferred.

---

## Hydrate Behavior

> **This section is the hydrate block — it always runs in a dispatched sub-agent** per the sub-agent dispatch contract in Normal Flow Step 1: the block runs no `fab status` command and returns completion status only; the sequencer runs the `finish` transition. Step 7 below (Return completion status) is the sequencer's, shown for the end-to-end picture.

### Preconditions

- `progress.review` MUST be `done`. If not: STOP.
- All items in `plan.md` `## Tasks` and `## Acceptance` MUST be `[x]`

### Steps

1. Final validation: all `## Tasks` and `## Acceptance` items in `plan.md` are `[x]`
2. Concurrent change check: warn on overlap with other changes referencing same memory paths
3. **Read `## Deletion Candidates`** from `plan.md` when present — informational only. Hydrate MAY reference candidates in memory updates (e.g., a Design Decision noting follow-up cleanup). Hydrate MUST NOT generate or modify the section (generation is review's responsibility) and MUST treat an absent section as "no findings" without error
4. Hydrate `docs/memory/`:
   - **FKF frontmatter (from template)**: create new files/domains from the canonical memory-file shape — **read `$(fab kit-path)/templates/memory.md`** (the single source of truth for the shape, the same on-demand template read used for `$(fab kit-path)/templates/intake.md`) and fill its FKF frontmatter (`type: memory` constant plus a curated `description:` one-liner, per `$(fab kit-path)/reference/fkf.md` §3.1–§3.2) and body skeleton. The `description:` is a curated **one-line index-row summary capped at 500 characters and free of change-ids** (FKF §3.2) — a routing signal, not a summary or provenance record; put detail *and* provenance citations in the body (`## Overview`/`## Requirements`/`## Design Decisions`), never in the description (`fab memory-index` warns over the 500 cap — advisory to 1000 runes, blocking `--check` past it; a change-id in the description is likewise a blocking finding). Update existing files (Requirements, Design Decisions, keep `description:` accurate, **within the 500-char cap, and free of change-ids**, and **stamp the `type: memory` constant when an edited legacy file is missing it** so the file you touch becomes FKF-conforming — FKF §2/§3.1 require `type: memory` on every memory file, stamped by every memory writer). **After any body edit, re-check the `description:` still routes the file accurately** — one line, ≤500 chars, change-id-free (FKF §3.2). A body edit can leave the description stale (drifted far past cap, or now describing the wrong scope); re-reading it after the body grows is what keeps the routing signal accurate.
   - **No per-file `## Changelog`**: memory files no longer carry a `## Changelog` section (FKF §3.3) — instead, record what changed once via `fab status set-summary {change} "<one-line what-changed>"` (the C-lite `summary:` source line, FKF §6.3, authored once at hydrate; `fab memory-index` joins it with git history to generate the per-folder `log.md`).
   - **Bundle-relative cross-links**: any memory↔memory link you write MUST use the bundle-relative `/...` form (resolved from `docs/memory/`, FKF §7); links *out* of the bundle (to source, specs, URLs) stay repo-relative/absolute-URL.
   - **Merge as current truth (present-truth body style, FKF §3.3)**: the unit of memory is the **topic/section**, not the change. Before writing, locate the section that already documents this topic and **rewrite it to state current truth** — do NOT append (or update-in-place) a change-keyed delta entry. Superseded statements are **removed, not narrated**: never write "renamed X→Y in {id}", "this inverts {id}'s claim", or "was `old.value`" in the body. The change's dated *what* is already captured once via `fab status set-summary` → `log.md` (the C-lite step above), so the body carries no transition narration. Provenance in the body is citation-only — a trailing `(change-id)` / `*Introduced by*: {change-name}` (§3.3), and **headings carry no change-ids**: a heading names its topic (`## Dispatch States`), never a change (`### Dispatch States (xu0k)`) — never introduce a change-id-suffixed heading. This is the same present-truth rewrite `docs-hydrate-memory.md` performs; it also gives the idempotency the former by-change-name dedup gave — a re-run rewrites the same section to the same current truth without duplicating it.
   - **Rationale → Design Decisions, not narration**: any *why*, rejected alternative, or constraint explanation goes into a `## Design Decisions` entry in the four-field shape (**Decision** / **Why** / **Rejected** / *Introduced by*), never as inline narration in Overview/Requirements prose (FKF §3.3). The **changelog-bullet shape is banned inside `## Design Decisions`**: an entry like `- **{change-id} — retired X**` is change history (`log.md`'s job, §6), not a design decision — a DD entry heading is a decision *title*, never a change-id.
5. **Post-hydrate self-check** (scoped to files touched *this run*, runs **before** the index regen in step 6): re-read every file you touched this run and strip any transition phrasing you just introduced — no "renamed / now / previously / no longer / was `old.value`" narration, no change-keyed delta paragraph left below an older paragraph on the same topic, no change-ids in headings — and confirm each touched file's `description:` still routes (one line, ≤500 chars, change-id-free). This is a self-review of *this hydrate's own writes*, not a corpus sweep (draining pre-existing debt across the tree is `/docs-distill-memory`'s job). A merge that already rewrote each section to current truth leaves nothing to strip — the check is the safety net that catches narration reflexively introduced during the write.
6. **Regenerate indexes**: run `fab memory-index` to regenerate the root (domains-only), domain, and sub-domain indexes — never hand-edit index rows. On any merge conflict in a generated `docs/memory/**/index.md` or `log.md`, do **not** hand-merge: resolve the topic files, re-run `fab memory-index`, take its output wholesale (FKF §5, `$(fab kit-path)/reference/fkf.md`).
   - **Refuse-before-regen guard (defense-in-depth)**: before that regen, consult `fab memory-index --check`; on **exit 2** (destructive loss) refuse to regenerate and surface the pointer `→ run /docs-reorg-memory to remediate ...` (the orchestrator that relocates tombstone rows and dispatches `/docs-hydrate-memory` backfill mode for descriptions; backfill alone does not relocate tombstones). This guard is a **no-op for born-compatible fab-kit trees** — a tree hydrated by the pipeline is always exit 0/1, never 2, so the guard never fires here (do not mistake it for dead code or remove it); it is defense-in-depth for the pathological case of a pre-fab-kit tree reaching the pipeline's hydrate stage.
   - **Shape SHOULD guidance**: aim for ~5–12 files/folder, depth ≤3, introduce a sub-domain only for a cohesive ≥8-file cluster; `_shared/` and `_unsorted/` are width-exempt. Heed any non-fatal shape warnings `fab memory-index` prints (advisory only).
7. Return completion status — the sequencer runs `fab status finish <change> hydrate fab-continue` after the block returns (the block runs no `fab status` command)
8. **Pattern capture** *(optional)*: If the change introduced non-obvious implementation patterns that future changes should follow (e.g., a new error handling approach, a reusable abstraction), note them in the relevant memory file's `## Design Decisions` section as a **four-field entry** (**Decision** / **Why** / **Rejected** / *Introduced by*) stating present-tense design intent — provenance is the `*Introduced by*: {change-name}` field (or a trailing `(change-id)` citation), never free-text change-name narration in the prose and never a `- **{change-id} — …**` changelog bullet (FKF §3.3). Skip for implementations that follow existing patterns without introducing new ones

---

## Reset Flow (with stage argument)

1. **Validate**: Must be one of the 6 stage names. If `tasks` or `spec` is passed, error with: `"tasks"/"spec" stages were removed — use /fab-continue apply to re-run apply (delete plan.md first to force regeneration), or /fab-continue intake then /fab-clarify to rework the intake.`
2. **Load context** for the target stage
3. **Reset `.status.yaml`**: Reset's From-set is `{done, ready, skipped}` — handle the non-resettable current states first:
   - Target already **`active`** (e.g., re-running an interrupted reset): skip this call — the state is already what the reset would produce; proceed directly to step 4 (re-running a reset is a state-wise no-op — idempotency, a fab-kit design principle).
   - Target **`failed`** (review/review-pr only — no other stage can hold it): do NOT reset — `failed` recovery belongs to `start` (failed → active). Stop the Reset Flow and follow the matching `failed` dispatch row in Step 1 instead (review → post-fail reset + rework menu; review-pr → re-execute `/git-pr-review` behavior).
   - Target **`pending`**: error — `Stage '{stage}' has not run yet — nothing to reset. Run /fab-continue to advance to it.`
   Otherwise run `fab status reset <change> <stage> fab-continue`. This atomically sets the target stage → `active` and cascades all downstream stages → `pending`. Stages before the target are preserved.
4. **Execute**: Intake reset regenerates the intake artifact. Execution stages (apply onward) re-run (task checkboxes NOT reset; `plan.md` is also preserved on disk — to force plan regeneration the user MUST delete `plan.md` before re-running `/fab-continue`).
5. **Invalidate downstream**: intake reset → all downstream pending. The `reset` command handles the status cascading automatically.
6. **Post-execution**: For the **intake reset**, after regenerating the artifact, use `fab status advance <change> <stage>` to move intake back to `ready` and stop there — **do not** run `finish`, to avoid auto-activating apply. For **execution resets**, use the normal `finish` commands, which will auto-activate the next pending stage.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `intake.md` missing for apply entry | "No intake.md found. Run /fab-continue intake to regenerate the intake first." *(the intake reset route — plain `/fab-continue` would re-enter apply and hit this same error)* |
| `plan.md` missing `## Acceptance` for review | "plan.md missing Acceptance section." |
| Incomplete tasks for review | "{N} of {total} tasks incomplete." |
| Review not passed for hydrate | "Review has not passed." |
| Reset target `tasks` or `spec` | `"tasks"/"spec" stages were removed — use /fab-continue apply to re-run apply (delete plan.md first to force regeneration), or /fab-continue intake then /fab-clarify to rework the intake.` |
| Unknown reset target | "Unknown stage. Valid: intake, apply, review, hydrate, ship, review-pr." |
| Template file missing | "Template not found — kit may be corrupted." |

> Recovery commands in these messages are shown argless: the change reference of the current invocation is implied (active, or the `[change-name]` override). When this invocation targeted an override change, re-run the suggested command with the same `<change-name>`.

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Idempotent? | Yes — planning regenerates, apply resumes, review re-validates, hydrate merges as current truth (a re-run rewrites the same topic section to the same truth without duplicating it) |
| Modifies source code? | Yes — during apply |
| Modifies `docs/memory/`? | Yes — during hydrate |
| Moves change folder / removes `.fab-status.yaml`? | No — use `/fab-archive` |
