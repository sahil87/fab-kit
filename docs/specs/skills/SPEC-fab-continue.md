## Summary

Advances through the 6-stage pipeline one step at a time. Each invocation handles the current stage's work and transitions to the next. Supports reset to a given stage (legacy `tasks`/`spec` targets error with a pointer to the `apply` and `intake` reset routes). Handles all six stages: intake (the only planning stage), apply (co-generates `plan.md` `## Requirements` + `## Tasks` + `## Acceptance` at entry then runs tasks), review (sub-agent), hydrate, ship (delegates to `/git-pr` behavior), and review-pr (delegates to `/git-pr-review` behavior).

**Single post-intake execution mode — one-stage sequencer** (260613-fgxx): intake is the sole context boundary. Intake is the only stage `/fab-continue` runs in the main session; **every post-intake stage (apply / review / hydrate) is always dispatched as a sub-agent**, the same dispatch the orchestrators (`_pipeline.md`) perform. There is no foreground execution path for apply/review/hydrate. In this mode `/fab-continue` is a **one-stage sequencer**: it runs `fab resolve-agent <stage> --alias` immediately before the dispatch and applies the resolved tier (the two-seam model-param + effort-via-prompt mechanics are described in the **Per-stage model** paragraph below), includes the universal **block-contract carve-out** prompt contract, reads the returned status/findings, and owns the `finish`/`fail`/`reset` transition itself — identical sequencer/block split whether the caller is manual `/fab-continue` or an orchestrator. As of **260702-aetz (3d)** the Step 1 dispatch contract **branches on the resolved `dispatch=` line** (surfaced alongside `model=/effort=`): absent ⇒ native Agent-tool dispatch (the two seams); present ⇒ the CLI adapter (`fab dispatch`, per `_preamble.md` § CLI-Adapter Dispatch). The block-contract carve-out the prompt carries is refined: it prohibits `fab status` *transition* commands (`start`/`advance`/`finish`/`reset`/`fail`/`skip`) but REQUIRES a terminal `fab status refresh` (a pull-based recompute, not a transition; the sequencer still owns every transition). As of **260704-pag2** the review stage dispatches a **single** review sub-agent whose prompt carries both checklists (plan-conformance steps + holistic-diff focus areas), so there is no nested reviewer dispatch, no parallel dispatch, and no review-stage nesting degradation — native and CLI dispatch are structurally identical for review (one worker runs the whole review inline). The three former dual-mode "When invoked as a subagent: do NOT run `fab status`" conditionals (Apply/Review/Hydrate Behavior) are removed; the instruction is now the universal block contract, not a per-caller override, and is NOT re-encoded as any "skip §Verdict when subagent" flag. Ship and review-pr are excluded from this rewrite — they self-manage their transitions (the dispatch exception).

**Failure recovery + idempotent reset** (260612-w7dp): a `review-pr`/`failed` dispatch row — keyed off `progress.review-pr == failed`, the same progress-map guard mechanism as the review row — re-executes `/git-pr-review` behavior (its Step 0 `start` accepts `failed → active` for review-pr; never `reset`, whose From-set `{done, ready, skipped}` excludes `failed`), so a failed PR review no longer falls through to "Change is complete." The ship and review-pr rows (incl. the failed row) pass the resolved change **explicitly** to `/git-pr`/`/git-pr-review` (`{name}` as the `<change>` argument — the explicit-arg contract); the ship and review-pr **`active`** rows key on `active` only — `ready` is not in either stage's AllowedStates — while the review-pr failed row keys on the progress map's `failed`. The Reset Flow handles all non-resettable target states (reset From-set `{done, ready, skipped}`): already-`active` → skip the call and proceed (re-running a reset is a state-wise no-op — idempotency, a fab-kit design principle); `failed` → route via the matching failed dispatch row (`start` owns failed→active, review/review-pr only); `pending` → error with advance guidance. All recovery pointers are executable: the unexecutable `/fab-clarify intake` form is replaced by `/fab-continue intake` then argless `/fab-clarify` (argless is correct in fab-continue's own messages — the change reference of the current invocation is implied, active or `[change-name]` override, and an Error Handling note tells override users to re-run with the same `<change-name>`; cross-context sites like `_pipeline.md`'s stop guidance instead name the change in every command), with an explicit delete-`plan.md` note where plan regeneration is the intent; the `intake.md`-missing error points at `/fab-continue intake` instead of looping through plain `/fab-continue`. The **sequencer** (Normal Flow Step 1's review dispatch) reads `change_type` from `.status.yaml` and carries it in the block dispatch prompt per `_review.md`'s context contract — the dispatched review block does not read it itself (the parsimony/deletion-candidate skip condition keys on the prompt value).

**Per-stage model** (260613-l3ja, 260613-fgxx, 260613-m3d4, 260613-yky7): the one-stage sequencer resolves `fab resolve-agent <stage> --alias` immediately before dispatching each post-intake stage's block (`--alias` since 260613-yky7 — emits the Agent-tool-valid short alias on the `model=` line), **surfaces** the resolved `model=/effort=` (visibility — a skip is detectable, not silent; m3d4), and applies both halves via two seams: model on the Agent `model` param (empty ⇒ omit/inherit) and effort as an imperative instruction in the sub-agent's prompt (no Agent effort param; omitted when empty; m3d4). Since every post-intake stage now dispatches, per-stage selection applies uniformly across apply/review/hydrate regardless of caller — there is no foreground post-intake path left to be the advisory-only exception (this closes Gap 1a of the model-tier finding; Gap 1b visibility + Gap 2's effort half are closed by m3d4 via the surface + prompt-injection seams; the lone residual is a first-class per-sub-agent effort param on the Agent tool — a harness ask, not built). Review is unexceptional (260704-pag2): the sequencer resolves `fab resolve-agent review --alias` once for the **single** review sub-agent, exactly like every other stage — there is no second nested resolution for reviewers + merge (the Claude Code adapter is the Agent tool `model` param, effort rides the prompt; resolution is provider-neutral — see `_preamble.md` § Subagent Dispatch → Per-Stage Model Resolution). Intake is pre-boundary and is not tiered by `/fab-continue`.

**Helpers**: Declares `helpers: [_srad]` in frontmatter; `_generation` and `_review` are loaded **stage-conditionally** at point of use (apply entry / intake regeneration → `_generation`; Review Behavior entry → `_review`) per `_preamble.md` § Skill Helper Declaration stage-conditional loading. Hydrate/ship/review-pr invocations and apply-resumes load neither.

**FKF hydrate prose** (260615-8fr5, 260616-2fm8): Hydrate Behavior authors memory files to the FKF contract — the shipped normative extract at `$(fab kit-path)/reference/fkf.md` (260616-frlo; mirror of the dev-repo design doc `docs/specs/fkf.md`). New memory files are created from the canonical memory-file template shipped at `$(fab kit-path)/templates/memory.md` (260616-2fm8) — read on demand the same way `_generation.md`/`_intake.md` read `$(fab kit-path)/templates/intake.md` — the single source of truth for the FKF frontmatter pair — `type: memory` (constant, §3.1) plus a curated `description:` one-liner (§3.2) — and the body skeleton; not `description:` alone. As of **260715-xu0k** Hydrate Step 4 states the `description:` **500-character one-liner cap** (§3.2 — a routing signal, not a summary of record; detail belongs in the body, `fab memory-index` warns over the cap) and carries the **never-hand-merge pointer** on the `fab memory-index` regen bullet (a generated `docs/memory/**/index.md`/`log.md` conflict is resolved by fixing topic files + re-running, taking output wholesale — FKF §5, never hand-merged). Hydrate no longer writes a per-file `## Changelog` section (§3.3): it records what changed once via `fab status set-summary {change} "<one-line what-changed>"` (the C-lite `summary:` source line, §6.3, authored once at hydrate), which `fab memory-index` joins with git history to generate the per-folder `log.md` (§6). Memory↔memory cross-links use the bundle-relative `/...` form (§7); links out of the bundle stay repo-relative/absolute-URL. The "update existing" section list drops `Changelog` (now Requirements/Design Decisions only); the merge-without-duplication contract is unchanged. When hydrate edits an existing/legacy memory file missing `type: memory`, it stamps the constant in so the touched file becomes FKF-conforming (§2/§3.1 require `type: memory` on every memory file, stamped by every memory writer — not just on creation). This is FKF migration Change 3/4 — it stops *new* changelog writes; the strip of the 20 existing `## Changelog` sections is Change 4/4.

**Prose optimization** (260620-skop): skill content trimmed to remove re-explanation of partial-owned concepts — the ~5 near-identical "dispatched block / sequencer owns transitions" blockquotes collapsed to one canonical statement (Normal Flow Step 1's dispatch contract) plus per-section references, the per-stage model paragraphs reduced to references, the Step 3 procedure table folded into prose, and Hydrate Step 4's long paragraph reformatted as a bullet list (same content); a `## Contents` TOC added to both the skill and this SPEC. No behavioral change (Flow / Tools / Sub-agents unchanged).

> **Dispatch annotation** (260613-fgxx; 260702-aetz): in the APPLY / REVIEW / HYDRATE boxes above, the stage *work* runs inside a dispatched sub-agent (resolved via `fab resolve-agent <stage> --alias`, then **branched on `dispatch=`** — native Agent-tool dispatch when absent, the CLI adapter `fab dispatch` when present, 260702-aetz — dispatched by the one-stage sequencer). The `Bash: fab status finish/fail/reset` lines shown in those boxes are run by the **sequencer** after the block returns — the dispatched block runs **no `fab status` transition command** (its prompt carries the carve-out: no transition commands, but a terminal `fab status refresh` — a pull-based recompute — is required). The boxes show the end-to-end stage picture, not block-internal actions. INTAKE is the only box that runs in the main session.

### Tools used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Read | Preamble, templates, artifacts, source files, memory |
| Write | Plan (`plan.md`), memory files |
| Edit | Plan (mark `## Tasks` and `## Acceptance` items [x]), memory files |
| Bash | All `fab status` transitions, `fab preflight`, `fab status set-summary` (hydrate — the C-lite `summary:` source for the generated `log.md`), `fab memory-index` (+ a `fab memory-index --check` refuse-before-regen guard at the hydrate stage — defense-in-depth, refuses on exit 2, a no-op on born-compatible trees), test execution — no `fab score` (no scoring at any stage `/fab-continue` runs; intake scoring belongs to `/fab-new`/`/fab-clarify`) |
| Agent | Single review sub-agent (general-purpose) — the sequencer dispatches one worker that reads `_review.md` and runs the whole review inline |

### Sub-agents

| Agent | Stage | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Single review sub-agent (`_review.md`) | review | Runs the whole review inline: `plan.md` validation (`## Requirements` + `## Tasks` + `## Acceptance`) with test execution (full mode) + holistic full-repo diff review via Codex→Claude cascade; returns one unified findings set |

> Review Behavior reads `.claude/skills/_review/SKILL.md` (if not already loaded) and executes its **Shared Review Dispatch** end-to-end (Review Mode → Preconditions → Review Agent Dispatch → Findings & Verdict) — `_review.md` is the single source of truth for the single review sub-agent's dispatch and findings shape. `fab-continue.md` retains the Verdict section (pass/fail state transitions, rework options).

> **Universal block contract** (f006, revised 260613-fgxx; carve-out refined 260702-aetz): the Apply/Review/Hydrate behavior sections are **always** dispatched as sub-agents (by the manual `/fab-continue` one-stage sequencer in Path A and by `/fab-ff`/`/fab-fff` orchestrators in Paths B/C/D — identical dispatch; native Agent-tool or the CLI adapter `fab dispatch` per the `dispatch=` branch). The dispatched block runs **no `fab status` transition command** (`start`/`advance`/`finish`/`reset`/`fail`/`skip`) and takes no §Verdict-style decision itself; it returns results/findings only — but its prompt DOES end with a terminal `fab status refresh` (a pull-based recompute, not a transition, per `_preamble.md` § Dispatch-Prompt Obligations). The owning sequencer (the manual `/fab-continue` invocation, or `_pipeline.md`) runs all `finish`/`fail`/`reset` transitions. This is no longer a per-caller conditional baked into the block — the former three "When invoked as a subagent: do NOT run `fab status`" blockquotes are removed and the instruction is the universal block contract, carried in the dispatch prompt. It is NOT re-encoded as a "skip §Verdict when subagent" flag — the Review block always returns findings; **who** acts on a fail verdict (interactive § Verdict menu in Path A vs. autonomous Auto-Rework Loop in B/C/D) is the orchestrator's concern. The ship dispatch row likewise only runs `finish <change> ship` if the stage is still `active` after `/git-pr` returns (git-pr finishes ship internally), and the review-pr row's Pass and Fail branches both carry the same only-if-still-active guard (git-pr-review's Step 6 runs its own finish/fail).

### Bookkeeping commands (hook candidates)

| Step | Command | Trigger |
|------|---------|---------|
| Plan generation | `fab status refresh` recomputes `plan.task_count`, `plan.acceptance_count`, sets `plan.generated=true` | Self-healed at the next advance/finish/preflight after plan.md write (no scoring at apply — intake is authoritative) |
| Review pass | `fab status set-acceptance <change> acceptance_completed N` | After review validation |
